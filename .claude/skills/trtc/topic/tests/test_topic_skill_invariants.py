"""Topic skill SKILL.md invariants — guards the post-redesign shape.

After the topic-skill redesign (2026-05-15), `topic/SKILL.md` was reduced
from 512 lines to ~390. Four structural invariants survived from that
work and need to stay true:

1. The "Apply Evidence Block" section was deleted — it instructed AI to
   run its own grep/ls/tsc, duplicating apply.py and giving AI an obvious
   bypass path.
2. The State Machine Guide was split out to
   `topic/scripts/STATE-MACHINE-GUIDE.md` and topic/SKILL.md just
   references it.
3. The "Calling apply" section is compact — the full request schema lives
   in `apply/SKILL.md` Phase 0; topic only references it.
4. topic/SKILL.md size stays within budget so we don't silently re-inline
   the things we split out.

Originally this file also enforced the §3.5 cross-skill handoff
convention ("must use Skill tool, never Read"). That convention was
walked back on 2026-05-18: the runtime never supported it (sub-skills
under `trtc/X/` aren't top-level discoverable, so `Skill(skill='trtc-X')`
returns "Unknown skill"). Plain Read handoff is the only working option
today. The §3.5-specific tests were removed; this file kept its other
four invariants. See `docs/topic-skill-long-term-design.md` §10 for the
walk-back rationale.
