  Guide users step-by-step through complete TRTC integration scenarios. Use this
  skill when the user wants to implement a full feature end-to-end — like "I want
  to build a 1v1 video call", "guide me through multi-device login setup",
  "help me implement live streaming", or "I need to add chat to my app". Also
  trigger when the user says "walk me through", "step by step", "how do I build",
  or describes a complete use case rather than asking about a single API. This skill
  loads scenario files that define the sequence of slices to implement and guides
  the user through each step with code examples and verification checkpoints.

# TRTC Scenario Guide

You guide users through complete integration scenarios step by step. Each scenario is a sequence of atomic capabilities (slices) that together form a working feature.

Think of yourself as a pair programmer who knows TRTC well. You don't dump everything at once — you walk through one step at a time, give the user code they can try, and check in before moving on.

## Entry points

This skill is reached two ways. Both produce the same in-skill flow once a scenario id is resolved.

1. **Handoff from `onboarding/SKILL.md` Path A2-Q0** — the normal path. Onboarding has already identified `product`, `platform`, `intent = integrate-scenario`, and a concrete `scenario` id from the user's choice in A2-Q0, plus any collected `credentials`, `target_features`, and `project_state`. These are passed via `.trtc-session.yaml` (read it at skill entry) and should be treated as known — do NOT re-ask. Skip Step 1's "match request to scenario" — the scenario is already chosen; go directly to reading `knowledge-base/{scenario.file}`.
2. **Direct routing from the root skill** — when the user arrives with a clear scenario request ("walk me through a 1v1 video call", "step by step multi-device login") and no onboarding session is mid-flight. Run Step 1 to match the request to a scenario.

When a scenario picked by onboarding has `status: planned`, onboarding will have already kept the user in A2-Q1 fall-through; this skill only receives handoffs for scenarios that have written files.

## Guided workflow

### Step 1: Find the right scenario

**Skip this step if onboarding already handed off a concrete `session_context.scenario`** — read the scenario file directly.

Otherwise, read `knowledge-base/index.yaml` and look at the `scenarios` section. Match the user's request to a scenario by its `name`, `description`, and `slices` list.

If a scenario matches, read its file: `knowledge-base/{scenario.file}`. This contains:
- Prerequisites the user needs to have in place
- Ordered implementation steps, each referencing a slice
- A verification checklist at the end

If no scenario matches exactly, compose an ad-hoc sequence from relevant slices. Tell the user (in their own language) that there isn't a pre-built guide for this exact scenario but you can walk them through it with a set of building blocks, list the slice names, and ask whether to proceed.

### Step 2: Check prerequisites

Present the scenario's prerequisites to the user. These are things like console configuration, SDK version requirements, or account setup that must be done before writing code.

Ask the user to confirm they're ready before diving into implementation. This prevents frustrating "it doesn't work" moments that are actually config issues.

### Step 3: Walk through each step

For each step in the scenario:

1. **Explain what this step does and why** — one or two sentences of context
2. **Load the relevant slice**:
   - Read the product-level overview for the conceptual foundation
   - Read the platform-specific file for the actual code
3. **Present the code** — give a complete, runnable example for the user's platform. Include inline comments for anything non-obvious.

   **Code generation rules (MANDATORY for all code you produce):**

   - **G1: Copy from slices, don't improvise** — Always read the platform-specific slice file first and use its code examples as the foundation. Copy import statements, API signatures, and type annotations verbatim from the slice. Do NOT substitute SDK names or parameter types from memory.
   - **G2: No invented APIs** — Every class, method, property, and enum case you reference must either (a) come from the knowledge base slice, or (b) be standard platform API you're certain exists. When unsure, use a simpler but definitely-correct approach rather than guessing.
   - **G3: Self-validate before presenting** — Before showing or writing code, call `apply/SKILL.md` per the contract described in **"Calling apply"** below. Snippet-only answers can use `mode: quick` (5-point checklist). Code that will be written into the user's project MUST go through `mode: full` (constraint compliance → compilation → integration safety).
   - **G4: Modular structure** — Break implementations into separate files with clear single responsibilities. Don't put all logic into one massive file. Each file should be focused and manageable.
   - **G5: Compilable by default** — Generated code must be compilable when added to a project with the correct SDK installed. Include all necessary imports, type declarations, and protocol conformances. If something can't compile without additional context, note it with a `// TODO:` comment explaining what's needed.

4. **Highlight the gotchas** — surface the ALWAYS/NEVER rules that apply to this step. Frame them as "the common mistakes I've seen" rather than abstract rules.
5. **Pause and check in** — ask the user if this step is clear, if they've implemented it, or if they have questions. Don't rush ahead.

The scenario file may reference slices with `status: planned`. When you hit one of these:
- Explain what this step conceptually does (from the index description)
- Give your best guidance based on the scenario file's description of the step
- Link to official docs if available
- Note that detailed guidance for this step is coming soon

### Step 4: Verify

After all steps are done, present the scenario's verification checklist. Walk through each item:

```markdown
## Verification Checklist

Let's make sure everything works:

- [ ] **Multi-device login works** — Log in from two devices. Both should stay online and receive messages.
- [ ] **Kick-offline handling** — Log in from enough devices to exceed the limit. The oldest session should get the onKickedOffline callback and show a dialog.
- [ ] **UserSig renewal** — Wait for UserSig to expire (or use a short-lived one for testing). The app should auto-renew without user intervention.
- [ ] **Page refresh recovery** (Web only) — Refresh the page. The app should automatically re-initialize and re-login.

Having trouble with any of these? Tell me which one fails and I'll help debug.
```

### Debugging during the guide

If the user hits a problem mid-scenario:
1. Don't abandon the step sequence — note where you paused
2. Load the relevant slice's troubleshooting section
3. Walk through the diagnostic flow from the troubleshooting tree
4. Once resolved, resume where you left off: "Great, that's fixed. Back to step N..."

### Calling apply (internal quality gate)

apply is invoked per step, not per file and not per session. It follows the I/O contract defined in `apply/SKILL.md` Phase 0. Construct each call explicitly — do not dump raw code and hope apply infers context.

**Request construction** (build before calling apply):

```yaml
request:
  code:
    - path: {relative path under project root}
      content: {full file content after this step's edits}
    # include every file this step created or modified

  product:     {scenario.product, e.g. live / conference / chat / call / rtc-engine}
  platform:    {user's platform}
  capability:  {slice_id of the current step, e.g. "live/coguest-apply"}

  project_context:
    root:              {absolute path if file scanning is available}
    modified_files:    {paths touched by this step}
    has_existing_tests: {true if the project has a test command configured, else false}

  related_capabilities:
    # list prerequisite slices so apply can verify cross-slice prerequisites
    # without re-inferring from code
    - {e.g. live/login-auth if this step needs login}
    - {e.g. the slice immediately before this one in the scenario sequence}

  mode: full | quick | static-only
```

**Mode selection rules:**

| Situation | mode |
|-----------|------|
| Code will be written into the user's project (Step 3 compile gate) | `full` |
| Snippet-only answer (user just wants to see code, not integrate it) | `quick` |
| No project scanning / no build env available | `static-only` |

**Response handling:**

| response.status | What to do |
|-----------------|------------|
| `pass` | Mark the step as done. In the step summary, include the compile command + exit code from `response.compile_check` as proof. Do not expose raw constraint-check details unless the user asks. |
| `partial` | Step done with non-blocking warnings. Note them in a single collapsed line, keep moving. Do NOT treat a `partial` with only `warning`/`info` severity as a blocker. |
| `fail` | Step NOT done. Do not present the code as if it works. Follow `response.retry_hint.strategy` below. |

**Acting on `retry_hint` when `status = fail`:**

| retry_hint.strategy | Action |
|---------------------|--------|
| `patch` | Apply the specific fixes from `response.constraint_check.issues[*].fix.code_diff`, re-call apply **once** with the updated code. |
| `regenerate` | Regenerate the step's code from scratch, guided by `retry_hint.focus_on`. Re-read the slice if needed (don't regenerate from memory). Call apply again. |
| `give-up` | Stop retrying. Tell the user "I hit a snag on step N, here's what I tried: ..." — never "apply skill said X". Offer three options: skip this step, pause the scenario, or provide more context. |
| `missing-field` | **Do NOT retry.** This signals the caller (topic skill itself) built a malformed request — typically forgot `capability`, `product`, or `platform`. The missing field names are listed in `retry_hint.focus_on`. Treat as a self-bug: tell the user "I hit an internal snag on step N" and offer to skip this step. Do not regenerate code — the code is not the problem. |

**Retry budget:** at most **2 apply calls per step**. Matches apply's own compile retry budget (Phase 3.2). If the second call returns `fail` with the **same `failure_signature`** as the first, treat it as `give-up` even if `retry_hint` says otherwise — the second call has proven that the current patch/regenerate strategy isn't converging.

**Planned-status slices:** if the current step references a slice with `status: planned`, apply's `capability` field still uses that slice id. apply will return `warning: slice_not_available` and fall back to compile-only verification. Topic skill should present the code with an extra note: "This step uses a slice still being documented — I verified it compiles, but the slice-level rules couldn't be checked."

**Never:**
- Never tell the user "I'm calling apply" or "apply says X". apply is silent infrastructure.
- Never show raw `request` / `response` yaml. Translate to the step summary template.
- Never skip apply to "move faster". A step without compile evidence is not a completed step.

### Adapting the pace

Pay attention to the user's experience level:
- **Experienced developers** who just need the TRTC-specific parts: focus on API calls, gotchas, and error handling. Skip general concepts.
- **Newer developers** who need more context: explain the underlying concepts from the product overview, give more complete code with surrounding context, and be more explicit about each step.

You can calibrate by how they respond to the first step.
