"""Shared helpers for reading .trtc-session.yaml state.

trtc_prepare_ui.py and trtc_verify_ui.py both consume session state. Helpers
are centralised here so the two scripts can't drift on parsing/validation.

The full scope contract for ui_mode hooks (see in_scope below):
  ui_mode == "full-ui"
    AND product == "conference"
    AND intent == "integrate-scenario"
    AND scenario is registered with a theme

The first three guard against hooks acting on unrelated workflows (live /
chat / troubleshoot / demo). The fourth ties theme selection to the registry,
so adding/removing themed scenarios is yaml-only.
