## About Tencent RTC

[Tencent RTC](https://trtc.io) (Real-Time Communication) powers real-time audio, video, and conversational AI experiences for thousands of businesses worldwide. With a global edge network spanning 200+ countries and regions, TRTC delivers sub-300ms ultra-low latency at scale.

The **Conversational AI** capability enables developers to build voice agents that can listen, understand, and respond naturally — perfect for customer service, sales assistance, and intelligent self-service scenarios.

## What is this?

Building an "AI customer service agent with TRTC Conversational AI" packaged into a plug-and-play Skill:

```
You (in your IDE's AI chat window):
  "Build me an AI customer service agent with TRTC"

AI (does everything automatically):
  1. Checks your runtime environment
  2. Lets you choose a setup mode (Quick Experience / Integrate into My System)
  3. Guides you through configuring 3 keys (cloud service credentials)
  4. Installs dependencies and assembles the customer service capabilities
  5. Starts the service and gives you a browser URL to see it in action

You never open a terminal or run a script manually.
```

## Two ways to start

> The core capability of this Skill is **TRTC Conversational AI (voice agent)**.

| Mode | Who it's for | What you get | What you need to do |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Quick Experience** | First-timers who want to see what it looks like | A complete voice agent web UI + ticket management dashboard | Configure 3 keys |
| **Integrate into My System** | Users who already have a website or app and want to embed the AI agent's "brain" | Backend API endpoints + interface specs + sample code (no UI generated) | Configure 3 keys + choose capabilities and interaction modes |

**No matter which one you choose, the AI will walk you through every step** — zero programming experience needed.

## The only entry point

[`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md) — Read and executed by your Coding Agent (CodeBuddy / Cursor / Claude Code).

> **Install anywhere**: This Skill can live in a project subdirectory, `.agents/skills/`, `.codebuddy/skills/`, or anywhere else —
> it does **not** need to be at the workspace root. Scripts are self-locating; the Agent just needs to use absolute paths.

### Installation

#### Codex CLI

**User-level** (recommended — available across all projects):
```bash
/skills install https://github.com/Tencent-RTC/agent-skills
```

**Project-level** (only available in the current project):
```bash
# The skill will be installed to ./.codex/skills/ (Cmd+Shift+. to show hidden folders in Finder)
/skills install --project https://github.com/Tencent-RTC/agent-skills
```

#### Claude Code CLI

**User-level** (recommended — available across all projects):
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/Tencent-RTC/agent-skills.git ~/.claude/skills/agent-skills
```

**Project-level** (only available in the current project):
```bash
mkdir -p ./.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/Tencent-RTC/agent-skills.git ./.claude/skills/agent-skills
```

#### Other agents (CodeBuddy / Cursor / etc.)

Clone to any location and point your agent to `SKILL.md`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tencent-RTC/agent-skills.git
# Then tell your agent:
# "Load the Skill from /path/to/agent-skills/skills/trtc-ai-service/SKILL.md"
```

> **After installation, restart your CLI session** to ensure the Skill is properly registered and loaded.

### Trigger keywords

- "AI customer service" / "build customer service" / "customer service bot"
- "TRTC + customer service" / "voice agent + customer service"
- "Build me an AI customer service agent with TRTC"

## What are the 3 keys?

To get the customer service agent running, you need 3 cloud service credentials. Don't worry — they're just 3 strings you copy-paste from the corresponding websites.

> **How are TRTC and Tencent Cloud connected?** The TRTC Conversational AI service runs on Tencent Cloud. In simple terms: TRTC handles the voice calls between your customers and the AI agent, while Tencent Cloud handles the backend (permissions, service setup, billing, etc.). The two share the same login — register once and you're all set.

| Key | Purpose | Where to find it |
|-----|---------|-----------------|
| Key 1: TRTC Application Credentials | Lets the agent make calls and do voice chat | https://console.trtc.io/ (register & create an **RTC Engine** app — supports Conversational AI) |
| Key 2: Tencent Cloud API Key | Proves you have permission to use Tencent Cloud voice & calling services (login syncs with your TRTC account) | https://console.tencentcloud.com/cam/capi |
| Key 3: LLM API Key | Lets the agent "think" — understand queries and respond | Your registered AI service website (e.g. OpenAI, DeepSeek, etc.) |

> The AI will tell you exactly how to get each key step by step. Your key info is only used for this configuration session — the system does not log or leak it.

## What capabilities does the agent have?

| Capability | Description | Quick Experience | Integration |
|------------|-------------|:---:|:---:|
| Conversation | Voice + text two-way communication | ✅ Auto-assembled | ✅ Default included |
| Knowledge Base | Upload docs, agent auto-retrieves and answers FAQ | ✅ Simulated demo | 🔘 Optional |
| Human Handoff | Complex issues auto-escalate to a human agent | ✅ Simulated demo | 🔘 Optional |
| Tool Calling | Agent can proactively query data from your system | ❌ Not supported | 🔘 Optional |
| Session Summary | Auto-generates a summary after each conversation | ✅ Simulated demo | 🔘 Optional |

> "Simulated demo" means: the UI and workflow are complete, but uses demo data without connecting to a real business system. For real integration, choose "Integrate into My System".

## Communication modes (optional for integration)

| Mode | Description | Best for |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Text-only IM | Agent replies via text chat | Web chat widgets, in-app messaging |
| Text + TTS | Agent types replies + reads them aloud | Smart speakers, voice assistants |
| Omni-modal | Text, voice, and video all supported | Advanced customer service scenarios |
| Voice-only Call | Agent communicates only via phone | Call centers, hotlines |

## Advanced: Customize TRTC Conversational AI

If you want to fine-tune the AI agent's voice behavior or change the underlying models, refer to the official TRTC Conversational AI documentation:

### Adjust voice parameters (speed / pitch / timbre)

Both STT (speech-to-text) and TTS (text-to-speech) are powered by Tencent's in-house engines. You can adjust voice parameters via the following documentation:

| Stage | Documentation |
|-------|--------------|
| STT (Speech-to-Text) | [STT configuration parameters](https://trtc.io/document/69592?product=conversationalai) |
| TTS (Text-to-Speech) | [TTS configuration parameters](https://trtc.io/document/68340?product=conversationalai) |

### Switch STT / LLM / TTS models

To change the underlying STT, LLM, or TTS models, check the model overview for each pipeline stage and follow the integration guide:

| Stage | Documentation |
|-------|--------------|
| STT (Speech-to-Text) | [STT Model Overview](https://trtc.io/document/69592?product=conversationalai) |
| LLM (Language Model) | [LLM Model Overview](https://trtc.io/document/68338?product=conversationalai) |
| TTS (Text-to-Speech) | [TTS Model Overview](https://trtc.io/document/68340?product=conversationalai) |

## FAQ

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Key verification failed | Go back to the key configuration step and double-check each key value |
| Port 3000 is in use | Use a different port (e.g. `--port 8080`) or stop the program occupying the port |
| Python version too low | Download and install Python 3.9+ from python.org |
| Browser shows blank page after startup | Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) |
| Want to connect a real business system | Re-run the workflow and choose "Integrate into My System" |
