# TRTC AI Integration

**English** | [简体中文](README.zh.md)

An agent skill provided by [TRTC](https://trtc.io) (Tencent Real-Time Communication) to help developers integrate real-time audio/video, live streaming, and instant messaging into their apps — from first setup to production-ready code.

Instead of reading through long documentation, you describe what you want to build in plain language. The skill routes your request to the right knowledge, asks a few clarifying questions, and walks you through the integration step by step.

You can use it to build scenarios like video conferencing, live streaming rooms, 1-on-1 video consultations, online classrooms, or customer support chat — across Web, iOS, Android, Flutter, and more.

### Installation

If your IDE doesn't have a plugin marketplace, or you'd rather pin the install to a specific project, use the npx installer. Run it inside your project directory:

```bash
# Default — auto-detect installed IDEs (~/.{claude,cursor,codebuddy,codex}/)
# and install for each one found. Falls back to claude if none detected.
npx -y @tencent-rtc/trtc-agent-skills add

# Force install for every supported IDE (even ones you don't have)
npx -y @tencent-rtc/trtc-agent-skills add --ide all

# Install only for one specific IDE
npx -y @tencent-rtc/trtc-agent-skills add --ide cursor

# Wipe a previous install before re-installing
npx -y @tencent-rtc/trtc-agent-skills add --clean
```

## What it does

The skill activates automatically when you mention TRTC or describe a real-time communication use case. No slash commands needed — just ask in plain language.

| | What it does | Example prompts |
|---|---|---|
| **Get started** | Guides you through demo setup, SDK integration, troubleshooting, or adding a new feature — step by step | • *"I want to add video conferencing to my web app"*<br>• *"I'm getting error 6206 when users join"*<br>• *"Conference is working — now I want to add screen sharing"* |
| **Scenario walkthrough** | Loads a complete feature scenario and walks you through each capability in order, with code and checkpoints | • *"Walk me through building a complete conference room from scratch"*<br>• *"Guide me through a 1-on-1 video consultation end to end"* |
| **Docs & lookup** | Answers factual questions from the official knowledge base with cited sources | • *"What does error code 6206 mean?"*<br>• *"How much does Conference cost per participant minute?"*<br>• *"What's the max number of participants?"* |

The skill saves your progress in the project. If you close the tool and come back later, it picks up where you left off.

## How It Works

When you describe what you want to build, the skill:

- **Identifies** your TRTC product and platform — from your message or by reading your project files
- **Asks** what you're trying to do: run a demo, start a new integration, troubleshoot an error, or add a feature to an existing project
- For integrations, **picks a scenario** from the knowledge base that matches your use case and shows you the full capability list — what will be implemented, in what order — before starting
- **Walks through** one capability at a time with production-ready code, waits for you to confirm it works, then moves to the next step
- **Saves your progress** to `.trtc-session.yaml` in your project root (auto-added to `.gitignore`) so you can resume in a later session without re-explaining what you're building

Step-by-step integration is currently available for **Conference on Web**. Docs lookup, error code search, and pricing questions work across all TRTC products (Conference, Live, Chat, Call, RTC Engine).

### Knowledge base: Slices and Scenarios

The skill's knowledge is structured into two layers:

**Slices** are atomic capability units — one slice per feature, such as `conference/join-room`, `conference/screen-share`, or `live/barrage`. Each slice has two levels:
- A product-level overview (concepts, best practices, troubleshooting, cross-platform notes)
- A platform-level implementation (exact APIs, code samples, platform-specific gotchas)

**Scenarios** are curated sequences of slices for complete use cases. For example, the *Conference Room* scenario chains multiple slices — from authentication and room creation through screen sharing, member management, and cleanup — in the order a real implementation would follow.
